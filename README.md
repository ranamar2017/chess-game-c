# Chess game C

This is an interactive chess program that applies a graphical user interface (GUI) and artificial intelligence (AI) based opponent.
All the project is written in C. This project is consist of two parts: backend and frontend: 

The frontend is done with SDL 2.0.5 library.
Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a cross-platform, open-source multimedia library written in C that present an interface to various graphics, sounds and input devices.<br><br>
For AI, I used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax"> Minimax algorithm </a>
with the optimization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning"> Alpha-beta pruning. </a> <br>
In general, Minimax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario.<br>
Alpha-beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree.

The rules of this game are the same as a regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess" > chess game</a>.<br>
